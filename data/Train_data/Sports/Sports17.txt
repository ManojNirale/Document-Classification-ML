Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka, 1st Test Day 2 Live Cricket score: The second day started big way in Sri Lanka’s favour with Rangana Herath getting the precious wicket of Mominul Haque who failed to score his maiden Test double hundred. Haque departed for 176 after he clipped one straight to short leg. Kusal Mendis took a good reflex catch and made no mistake as Bangladesh reached 376/5. Herath struck soon after once again, getting the wicket of Mosaddek Hossain, who played a poor shot and gifted his wicket to Sri Lanka. He departed for a meager total of 8 runs as Bangladesh looked early in trouble. Mehidy Hasan started strongly and looked to build a partnership with Mahmudullah. But he gave away his wicket trying to run a third run when it was not there and departed for 20 runs. But the 50-run partnership between Mahmudullah and Sunzamul Islam took the session away from Sri Lanka as the duo took their side to 467/7 at the close of the session. The visitors will look to wrap up the home side in the second session and come out to bat as soon as possible. Bangladesh, on the other hand, would look to quickly score to take the total somewhere close to 600.

The session after Lunch started in similar fashion as the first session with Sri Lanka taking quick wickets. Sanakan dismissed Sunzamul Islam for 24 and broke the partnership between him and Mahmudullah. Rangana Herath provided the second breakthrough in the session, dismissing  Taijul Islam for 1. But just when it looked like, Bangladesh’s innings would come to an end, Mahmudullah continued his resistance and took his side over 500. Lakmal dismissed Mustafizur Rahman as the home side were all out for 513.
