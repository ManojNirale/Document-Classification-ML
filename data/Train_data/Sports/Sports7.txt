Another day, another win for the Indian team. Five out of five in this tournament. No team really comes close to this Indian side. They have been a formidable force in all three departments. Pakistan were blunted by Shaw and Kalra early, and after that it was the Shubman Gill show all the way. Pakistan's fielding was exposed time and again in the first innings that cost them dearly. 272 proved to be way too much and Pakistan caved in after couple of early wickets. Though Mavi might not have wickets to show, he was excellent at the start and Porel enjoyed the wickets in what was a great partnership upfront. Spinners came in and wiped out the tail.

Next match, the big final against Australia on 3 February will start at 5:30 AM, which feels much better compared to coming to office at 2:30 AM! Anyway, it was another great day for the boys in blue. Hope you enjoyed it as well. Good to have you for company, will be here for the big final, do tune in.
