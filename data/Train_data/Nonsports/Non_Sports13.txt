The Indian economy appears to have absorbed the twin shocks of demonetisation and the hasty implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and is on course for healthy growth in the medium term. Essentially, this is what the Economic Survey 2017-18 says while listing quite a few parameters to show how the economy has been healing. The number of indirect taxpayers is up by 50 per cent, with 18 lakh new income-tax filers coming forward this year. Besides, there has been a large increase in voluntary registrations by small enterprises and an 18 per cent rise in direct tax collections. Therefore, despite the large-scale disruption to businesses and the economy in general, GST has led to greater formalisation and a wider tax net. This is surely good news.

Besides, the reversal in decline of exports and revival of manufacturing has meant that gross domestic product (GDP) estimates have improved. The Survey pegs current fiscal GDP growth at 6.75 per cent, ahead of the 6.5 per cent which the Central Statistical Office had estimated earlier. And next fiscal’s GDP growth has been set at 7-7.5 per cent, when India may once again become the fastest growing economy on the planet. Chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian has not been taken in by incessant questioning about which of these two numbers the growth is likely to be closer to, and wisely so. There are too many imponderables as of now, and there’s not much point in sticking out one’s neck to be any more precise.
