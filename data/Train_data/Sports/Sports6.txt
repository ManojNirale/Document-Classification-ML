New Delhi: While Saina Nehwal was easing past Denmark’s Sofie Holmboe Dahl on Court 3, HS Prannoy was having a brief chat with the chair umpire on Court 1. He gave away points cheaply in the opening game and as a result, lost the opening game 4-21 to unseeded Shreyansh Jaiswal. This caught the eye of the fans, as the World No 10 shuttler couldn’t even send the shuttle across the net in the second stanza.

In a matter of just 13 minutes, the tie was over. Jaiswal, who competed at his maiden Superseries event, moved into the second round with a 21-4, 21-6 win. The result was a huge shock for the fans considering Prannoy’s ranking and form. However, the 25-year-old later revealed that he was forced to play the match despite carrying a foot corn that bothered him to move around with ease.

“I just participated here because of the new BWF rule of 12 mandatory tournaments. I already missed two tournaments in the start. I couldn’t afford another one so early in the season,” Prannoy told a select group of journalists after the loss.
